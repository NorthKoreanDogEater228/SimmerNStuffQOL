[h2][b]Shimmer And Stuff QOL[/b][/h2]

[h2]Sourse code (github):[/h2] https://github.com/NorthKoreanDogEater228/SimmerNStuffQOL

[h2]Description:[/h2]
In this project i implemented some intresting (maybe not very original) QOL ideas that came in my head during vanilla playthroughs.
All mod revolves around one original idea, that i had in mind when started this mod development, this idea being adding algorithm, that dynamically adds cykle shimmer transmutations for bossbag and crates (in fact every item that drop other items on LMB click and is listed in ItemDropDataBase) drops with equal drop chances (like class emblems from WOF).
After implementing this, i also added this system for NPC (mob) drops (with equal chances of cause).
Than i added crafting recipes for NPC and bossbag drops from NPC banner or bossbag.
Now merchant sells you all items from your hotbar! It'll cost you of cause (all multipliers and default prices are located in mod config).
When you have more than sertain number of ammo (can set it in config to) your gun won't use any more (When i added it i didn't realize that this feature allready exists in some oter QOL mod for nohitters).
All above mentioned features have full mod support because they use universal algorithms instead off adding all crafts by myself.
About multiplayer compatibility: i didn't test it yet, but all features exept merchant shop should not make problems (you can turn it off in config).
I also plan adding infinite arena buffs when item is in your inventory (if i will find a way to implement it with mod support).
